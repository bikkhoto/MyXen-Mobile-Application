# 1 — Decisions I made (best-practice, ready to use)

* **MYXN token in this phase:** Use the existing token you gave for now: `6S4eDdYXABgtmuk3waLM63U2KHgExcD9mco7MuyG9f5G`. We’ll switch to the final new token later with a migration plan.
* **Network for testing:** `devnet` for initial integration and QA. Use `mainnet-beta` only after audits & sign-off.
* **Token decimals:** `9` (standard for SPL).
* **Scope decisions:**

  * Support System: **Later (v1.1)** — not required for v1.0 shipping. Build as separate backend.
  * Native hardware keystore: **Yes — implement now** (high priority). Don’t rely on stub for long; native integration reduces risk and improves security.
  * Ads system: **Later** (optional — implement after product/UX completes).
  * University integration: **Later** (separate product subdomain; keep deep-links ready but implement post-launch).
* **Testing platform:** **Both Android & iOS.** Use emulators for fast CI/dev; require at least one physical device per OS for hardware-backed tests (Android StrongBox device and iOS device with Secure Enclave).

# 2 — Wallet & token configuration (use this block for Gemini / CI / engineers)

Save this as a config JSON (e.g., `config/myxen.token.json`) or in your env manager.

```json
{
  "myxn": {
    "mint_address": "6S4eDdYXABgtmuk3waLM63U2KHgExcD9mco7MuyG9f5G",
    "decimals": 9,

# 3 — Exact env vars to add to CI / mobile builds

Add these to your secrets manager / `.env` for devnet builds:

```
MYXN_MINT=6S4eDdYXABgtmuk3waLM63U2KHgExcD9mco7MuyG9f5G
MYXN_DECIMALS=9
SOLANA_CLUSTER=devnet
SOLANA_RPC=https://api.devnet.solana.com
TREASURY_WALLET=Azvjj21uXQzHbM9VHhyDfdbj14HD8Tef7ZuC1p7sEMk9
FEATURE_SUPPORT=false
FEATURE_NATIVE_KEYSTORE=true
```

# 4 — Immediate next steps (engineer checklist — do these now)

1. **Commit the config JSON** to `config/myxen.token.json` and wire the build to read those envs for devnet builds.
2. **Implement native keystore** (priority):

   * Android: StrongBox/AndroidKeyStore path.
   * iOS: Secure Enclave path.
   * Expose method channel `com.myxen.crypto/hardware_keystore` (we already prepared spec).
   * Run hardware tests on a physical device.
3. **Set mobile to use devnet** and ensure send/receive flow checks `$MYXN` mint address for allowed transfers (block other tokens as send).
4. **Add wallet list constants** to admin config (read-only in app where needed for treasury/charity addresses). Do **not** embed private keys in repo.
5. **Create migration stub**: a small script `tools/migrate_token.sh` that can switch the mint address and map balances later — prepare DB/schema to support `active_mint` vs `legacy_mint`.
6. **Schedule support system work for v1.1** — create a Jira/ticket epic and backlog using the support step-pack I provided.

# 5 — How to switch to the new $MYXN token later (migration plan summary)

1. Deploy new mint on mainnet and get new mint address.
2. Add new mint to `config/myxen.token.json` (field `future_mint`) and set `migration_window_start` date.
3. Announce migration to users + create on-chain swap mechanism (or mint distribution plan).
4. Run a controlled migration: mint bridging program or use snapshot + airdrop to treasury-managed wallets.
5. Update mobile builds to read `active_mint` from server feature-flag and push update.
6. After finalization, retire old mint in code and update docs.

# 6 — Policy & security reminders (do not skip)

* **Never store private keys or mnemonics in repo or CI logs.** Use secrets manager.
* **Only use provided public addresses** in config. Never commit seed phrases.
* **Audit the native keystore code** — plan to run the security audit (Step 11) after native integration is implemented.
* **Fees model:** Ensure UI always shows fee in `$MYXN` (and fiat equivalent) before confirming transactions.

# 7 — Quick answers to Gemini’s prompts (pasteable)

If Gemini asks again for a minimal response you can paste this:

```
