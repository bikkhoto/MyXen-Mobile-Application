## Security-Specific Guidelines

Given that MyXenPay handles sensitive financial operations and cryptographic keys:

1. **Never share or request** private keys, seed phrases, or credentials in any community channel
2. **Report security vulnerabilities** privately to security@myxen.foundation — never disclose publicly
3. **Do not attempt** unauthorized access to any systems, accounts, or user data
4. **Protect user privacy** — never share user information or transaction details
5. **Follow secure coding practices** as outlined in SECURITY.md and CONTRIBUTING.md

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include:

* Using an official email address
* Posting via an official social media account
* Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
* Contributing to the repository or related projects
* Participating in community discussions, forums, or chat channels

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
